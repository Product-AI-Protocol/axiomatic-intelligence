# Product AI Protocol: Axiomatic Intelligence
The official protocol for Axiomatic Intelligence: a post-probabilistic architecture for the Agent Economy. We replace probabilistic summarization with deterministic truth adjudication via the Kinetic Refinery. This repo hosts the v1.0 Whitepaper and the Kinetic Axiom schema definitions.

## Overview
Axiomatic Intelligence is a post-probabilistic architecture for commerce agents. Unlike standard LLMs which generate outputs based on statistical likelihood, the Axiomatic Protocol uses a **Kinetic Refinery** to adjudicate truth through adversarial signal collision.

## The Quad-Vector Architecture
This repository contains the core schema definitions for the Kinetic Axiom, the atomic unit of verified truth.
1. **Vector 1 (Thesis):** Marketing Claims
2. **Vector 2 (Physics):** Objective Measurement
3. **Vector 3 (Consensus):** Lived Experience
4. **Vector 4 (Ore):** Transactional Signal
